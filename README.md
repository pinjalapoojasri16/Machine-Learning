#project on Heart Disease Prediction

Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction of heart disease can help in timely treatment and lifestyle changes.
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease using multiple Machine Learning algorithms and compare their performance to find the best model.


Objectives

Build a robust predictive model for heart disease diagnosis.

Compare performance of different Machine Learning algorithms.

Deploy the model using Flask for an interactive web application.


Machine Learning Models Used

The following algorithms were implemented and evaluated:

Model	Description
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)	A simple distance-based algorithm for classification.
Logistic Regression	A linear model commonly used for binary classification.
Naive Bayes	A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem.
Decision Tree Classifier	A tree-based model that splits data based on feature importance.
Random Forest Classifier	An ensemble model using multiple decision trees for better accuracy.
AdaBoost Classifier	A boosting algorithm that combines weak learners into a strong model.
Gradient Boosting Classifier	An advanced ensemble model that optimizes prediction errors iteratively.
XGBoost Classifier	An optimized gradient boosting model offering high accuracy and speed.
Support Vector Machine (SVC)	A margin-based classifier that performs well on high-dimensional data.
